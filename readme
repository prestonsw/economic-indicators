economic-indicators is to track all the things that I might want to look at occasionally or daily. The end goal is to put all of these things into the most consumable way possible. This may take any of the following forms: 

- be placed into a dashboard that I generate on a daily basis
- be placed into an email delivery that I have an algorithm pick all the big daily movers for me to consume 
- be a repository of series that checks for interesting cointegration trends that are long term or temporary in the short term. This will help me find interesting trends that I may not discover otherwise.
